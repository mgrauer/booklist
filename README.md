 * Lincoln in the Bardo, by George Saunders
 
 XLI
 
 > In this they can be like wild dogs let into a slaughterhouse--racing about upon the spilled blood, driven mad by the certainty that some sort of satisfaction must be near at hand.

LII

 > A train approaches a wall at a fatal rate of speed. You hold a switch in your hand, that accomplishes you know not what: do you throw it? Disaster is otherwise assured. It costs you nothing. Why not try?

LXII

 > Oh, the pathos of it!--haggard, drawn into fixed lines of unutterable sadness, with a look of loneliness, as of a soul whose depth of sorrow and bitterness no human sympathy could ever reach. The impression I carred away was that I had seen, not so much the President of the United States, as the saddest man in the world. - Francis F. Browne. "The Every-Day Life of Abraham Lincoln: A Biography of the Great American President from an Entirely New Standpoint, with Fresh and Invaluable Material," account of Rev. George C. Noyes.

LXVL

> All men labor under some impingements on their freedom; none is absolutely at liberty.

XCIV

> His mind was freshly inclined towards *sorrow*; toward the fact that the world was full of sorrow; that everyone labored under some burden of sorrow; that all were suffering; that whatever way one took in this world, one must try to remember that all were suffering (none content; all wronged, neglected, overlooked, misunderstood), and therefore one must do what one could to lighten the load of those with whom one came into contact; that his current state of sorrow was not uniquely his, not at all, but, rather, its like had been felt, would yet be felt, by scores of others, in all times, in every time, and must not be prolonged or exaggerated, because in this state, he could be of no help to anyone and, given that his position in the world situated him to be either of great help or great harm, it would not do to stay low, if he could help it. ... All were in sorrow, or had been, or soon would be. ... It was the nature of things. ... Though on the surface it seemed every person was different, this was not true. ... At the core of each lay suffering; our eventual end, the many losses we must experience on the way to that end. ... We must try to see one another in this way. ... As suffering, limited beings-- ... Perenially outmatched by circumstance, inadequately endowed with compensitory graces. ... His sympathy extended to all in this instant, blundering, in its strict logic, across all divides.
