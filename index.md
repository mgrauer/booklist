Five Focusing Steps

1. IDENTIFY the system's constraint.
2. Decide how to EXPLOIT the system's constraint.
3. SUBORDINATE everything else to the above decisions.
4. ELEVATE the system's constraint.
5. If in the previous steps a constraint has been broken GO back to step 1,
   but do not allow INERTIA to cause a system constraint.
